Supervised Credit Card Fraud Analytics

This was a supervised problem since the data included a column that indicated whether an application was fraudulent or not. It also contained a number of other identifying data fields about the applicant, such as the SSN, address, or phone number used. The dataset had 1,000,000 records and 10 data fields.
